Where water companies underperform and do not meet their targets , a process is in place whereby basically they have to credit the money back to their customers . Last year , £ 143 million was credited back in that respect . So the regulator does have the tools to do that . It has tightened up so many of its measures , all of which will affect all the water companies . For information , Thames Water itself has not paid any dividends for the last six years . Ofwat will rightly hold companies to account when they do not clearly demonstrate the link between dividends and performance . We made that possible through the landmark Environment Act .
