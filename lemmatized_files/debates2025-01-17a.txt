Gentleman ' s point about timescale , because in my experience this issue be the one that be raise most commonly by resident want to see action . why on earth , they say , be new home be put up without solar panel on they ? time be of the essence , but be it not the case that we have already lose many opportunity to progress ? regulation be due to come into force in 2016 that would have require all new home to have zero carbon standard . those regulation be scrap by the coalition Government . [ hon . member : " no , they weren ' t . " ] the briefing I have have say that they be scrap in 2014 .
