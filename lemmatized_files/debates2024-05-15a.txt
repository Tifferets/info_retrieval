I know that this issue be very emotive . for all of we with constituent who be worried about their pension age , I remind they that pension credit provide a safety net for people on low income , so they should look at the benefit calculator on gov . uk . there will be a full debate on the ombudsman ' s report tomorrow , and the Government will take all view into account as we identify and implement the next step . the ombudsman ' s report be complex and substantial , and the investigation cover 30 year . I appreciate that all party want to see the situation resolve as quickly as possible . as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions have say , there will be no undue haste , and we will be listen to everyone .
