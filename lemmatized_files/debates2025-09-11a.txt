first , I thank the hon . Lady and all other member of the Committee for their engagement in this report and for the way in which they approach the work of the Committee as a whole . I may be slightly biased , but I really think they be quite excellent in the way they go about their business — I could not ask for a well membership . what we see at Dover be truly shocking . we be still close enough to lunch that I be not go to give too many detail , but the photograph that be provide to the Committee be truly horrendous . the hon . Lady suggest that the control point at Sevington and Bastion Point could be repurpose , which be an obvious solution . the condition in which the Port Health Authority worker operate be disgraceful : work in big shed that we probably would not keep cattle in , with hole in the roof and pigeon fly around . meanwhile , just a few mile up the road , there be purpose - build facility where worker would at least be able to change into their personal protective equipment and have proper shower at the end of the day . I place on the record the Committee ' s gratitude to , and my personal admiration of , Luzy Manzano and her team at the Dover Port Health Authority , who have do a remarkable job and a significant public service in bring this to the attention of the wide population .
