I want to provide some reassurance to the shadow Minister . under our scheme , no sexual offender , no terrorist offender and nobody who have be convict of a serious violent crime or be convict for four year or more will be eligible for early release . I would just remind he that the slight distinction between our scheme and that conduct under the last Labour Government between 2007 and 2010 be that we have a governor lock . that mean that the governor of any prison can prevent an individual prisoner from be release early if they do not think that it be suitable to do so , and that be not the case under the last Labour Government .
