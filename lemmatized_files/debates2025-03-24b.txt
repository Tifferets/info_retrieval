I thank my hon . friend for his speech and for highlight the gap that exist in local government . I be sure he will recognise that , as the Local Government Association and the National Housing Federation have say , only 80 % of local authority have the capacity at the moment — in fact , it could be far less . do he agree that that be a real concern ?
