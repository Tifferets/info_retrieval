I congratulate the hon . member for Glasgow North ( Patrick Grady ) on bring forward what be a genuinely interesting and surprisingly well - attend Adjournment debate . I think it be the well - attend Adjournment debate I have take for some time . be I in mischievous mood , I would gently refer he to the answer that I give he on 18 November , 29 February and 12 March and resume my place , but alas mischief elude I and I will give he as full an answer as I can . obviously the Government be consider the very good and serious report into this situation from the Procedure Committee . it be not an anomalous situation — it have arise before — but it be right that we should consider it in a modern light . in the meantime , while we be wait for the Government ' s full consideration , there be a number of way in which the Foreign Secretary be be hold to account by Parliament as a whole . in the House of Lords , he answer question on 21 November , 5 December , 15 January , 16 January , 13 February , 12 March and 15 March . I know that the House of Lords be not a place where the Scottish National party go to play . as the hon . Gentleman know , because we have debate this on a number of occasion , I think that be a great shame . I understand that the party ' s plan and vision to break up the kingdom fail — with the support of the scottish people , I be pleased to say . after that juncture , SNP Members would have do well to accept that that be a once - in - a - generation vote and that they be plausibly go to be here for some time if people continue to elect SNP Members to this House . it would therefore have be wise of they to stick a few people in the upper House so that the view of their party and that part of the electorate could be represent in that part of Parliament . they choose not to . consequently they be now unable to question the Foreign Secretary when he stand to answer question in the Lords , but that be their prerogative .
