yesterday , Oxford doctor Nick Maynard and Deborah Harrington brief parliamentarian very movingly on their experience of treat people in Gaza . they impress on we how important it be that they be keep safe , and how many of their colleague have die . I be sure that the Minister and the whole House will thank they for their tireless work , as well as other aid worker , and anyone who give over their safety to save other . they also point out that the malnutrition that we see be make patient more vulnerable to infectious disease . a report release by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine project that if the situation continue as it be , there will be 74 , 000 excess death — that is , that number will die , over and beyond the number who have die by bomb , if something be not do . do the Minister agree that we need not only an immediate bilateral ceasefire , but rebuild of the medical situation in Gaza now , not later , because that be what be stop people get the life - save treatment that they desperately need ?
