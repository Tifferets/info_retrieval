I have a feeling that my hon . friend might mention Avanti , and he know my view . one of the first meeting I hold as Secretary of State be with Avanti . I call in representative of its Network Rail business unit for be one of the worst - perform operator — a meeting that be not hold by any of my three predecessor while I be shadow Secretary of State . I make it clear that Avanti ' s level of performance will not be tolerate , and we will use all measure under its national rail contract to hold it to account . that do not exclude terminate the contract before it expire if Avanti default . we be promise High Speed 2 to Manchester , yet that be axe — in Manchester , no less — leave a west coast main line that be now burst at the seam . meanwhile , passenger continue to suffer , with overcrowded train and poor facility , record - high cancellation — almost one in three train be late — some of the most expensive fare in Europe , and regular bout of industrial action . I call Vera Hobhouse . the A1 run through my constituency , but the same issue also apply to the new A14 , with similar dangerous junction . the 12 - mile section that include the stretch between Keystone and Ellington have both crossover and ungraded junction . do my hon . friend agree that on those stretch , Highways England should introduce a reduce speed limit of 50 mph where there be dangerous junction , as there be on the A1 , as an immediate measure prior to upgrade the junction and improve signage ?
