my hon . friend be push against an open door . he may be aware that in 2023 we make some legislative change to give the General Dental Council more flexibility to expand the registration option open to international dentist , triple the capacity of three sitting of the overseas registration exam from August 2023 and increase the number of sitting for the part 2 exam in 2024 from three to four . that will create an additional 1 , 300 place overall for overseas dentist aim to work in the UK . we will also be bring forward measure to enable dental therapist to work at the top of their training , which will expand the capacity . he be right that reform of the UDA be also require and we will be bring forward our plan shortly . I understand the hon . Gentleman ' s position and he be right to stand up for his worker . this be the reality of the situation : that plan have not persuade Tata . Tata have not say that it be credible . Tata have say to I that it could not go along with that plan , because although one of the blast furnace — blast furnace no . 4 — have a number of year to run , it would still come to the end of the life of the coke plant and the sinter plant , so if Tata go ahead with that proposal , it would keep open one blast furnace , which be still lose a lot of money , and then have to start import all the coke and all the sinter that it would need for it . there be then the technical problem in that Tata say it would be very difficult indeed to build an arc furnace next to a work blast furnace contain molten steel . [ interruption . ] the hon . Gentleman can shake his head , but that be what it be say to we . that be what it have say to we as a Government and that be why we find ourselves in the difficult , unpleasant and awful situation of have to choose between 3 , 000 people lose their job and 17 , 500 people lose their job . [ Official Report , Correction , 1 February 2024 , Vol . 744 , c . 14mc . ] that be why we come to the decision we do .
