I thank my right hon . friend for his work on the report and for his campaigning . let I also say , however , that procurement have start to improve . in 2009 - 10 , the average time delay on a project be 28 % ; it be now 15 % . the average cost overrun be 15 % on a project in 2009 - 10 ; it be now 4 % . the direction of travel be improve . the number of civil servant at DE & S go from 24 , 000 to 11 , 000 , so we be cut away the bureaucracy and the direction of travel be improve . in my time as Secretary of State for Defence , I be also determined to put to bed some of the problem project that we be all inheriting . I be pleased to say that , as I speak , Ajax be back on track and start to be deliver to the unit . the unit be start to train in it now . we could all have a discussion about whether we would have choose Ajax all those year ago , but fundamentally it have not cost the taxpayer any more money and it be be deliver to our frontline . I be determined to put that right , or take other step to deal with it . that should always be the case . the other thing that I have always try to do , which be not in the document but which I recommend in defence procurement , be to never defer — either delete or deliver . if you defer , it cost hundred of million of pound . defer the aircraft carrier cost £ 1 billion under the Labour Government . defer the F - 35 cost £ 500 million . deferral create the black hole . Delete or deliver , but don ' t defer .
