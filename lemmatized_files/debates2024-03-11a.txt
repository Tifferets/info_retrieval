I be sure that the hon . Gentleman will be delighted to learn that apprenticeship start be up by 3 % so far this year . that be because they be back by record investment of £ 2 . 7 billion . never before have a government invest so much into high - quality apprenticeship and achieve so much in spread opportunity across the country . as always , Labour Front Benchers be obsess with quantity over quality . we have transform the quality of apprenticeship . seventy per cent of occupation be cover by over 680 apprenticeship standard . there have be a 6 % increase since this time last year in the number of under - 19 start , and overall start be up by 3 % over the same period . the crucial thing be achievement , which be up by 22 % . female STEM start be up by 7 . 5 % , start by people with disability be up by 6 . 3 % , and start by people from ethnic minority be up by 15 . 4 % , compare with 10 . 6 % in 2010 . not only be we focus on quality over quantity ; we be improve the number of start and achievement too . my hon . friend speak a lot of wisdom . I congratulate Vandyke Upper School on its work . I have be to apprenticeship fair and career day at the Oasis Academy in Brislington . huge amount of work be go on with the career enterprise company and the apprenticeship ambassador network , to ensure that there be a network member engage at every secondary school and college . I have mention some of the other thing we be do to promote career and apprenticeship in all our school .
