I believe my hon . friend be refer to Veterans UK , which be be retire because I be well aware of the plethora of issue . we have staff there who work incredibly hard but with very poor resource , and consequently the experience of veteran have not be what I want it to be . we be retire that brand and completely revamp those service . I take on board the point about an mps hotline , which exist in other Departments , and I can confirm that we be look to establish the same thing in the new organisation to meet these claim .
