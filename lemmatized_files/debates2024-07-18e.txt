I will look at all proposal , but I think the hon . Gentleman know that underground cable cost six to 10 time more ; that be why the last Government do not agree to they . if part of our challenge be to cut bill for people , that be not a sustainable solution for the future . I be sympathetic to all mp who raise issue on behalf of their constituent , but I gently say again to he that if we want to avoid a repeat of the cost of living crisis , if we want to tackle the climate crisis , and if we want energy security , we will have to build the grid in our country .
