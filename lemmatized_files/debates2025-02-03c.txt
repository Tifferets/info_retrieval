follow the end of headline judgment in September , Ofsted undertake the big listen , and listen very carefully to feedback on the way it conduct inspection while also review the format for report on those inspection . I note the hon . Lady ' s comment in that regard . in the new system that have be design , that work have pave the way for the roll - out of school report card . subject to consultation — both the Government and Ofsted be very open to the view of the profession — they will be roll out in September . alongside a reform Ofsted , we be create the rise team , comprise of leader with a prove track record of improve school standard . those team will draw on bespoke improvement plan for stuck school , with significant investment . the previous Government make £ 6 , 000 available for stuck school ; under this government , it will be more like £ 100 , 000 per school to drive that improvement . the hon . Lady ' s comment in relation to SEND be well make . as I say to the Chair of the Select Committee , my hon . friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood ( Helen Hayes ) , that be something that Ofsted will be judge , look specifically at inclusion as well as — not instead of — high and rise attainment standard in school . the reformed accountability and improvement system very much build on the work of the Children ' s Wellbeing and Schools Bill , which will : require teacher to have , or work towards , qualified teacher status ; ensure that all school teach a cutting - edge national curriculum , follow the curriculum and assessment review ; and restore teaching as an attractive profession through a floor , but no ceiling , for pay and condition . all those reform combine will drive high and rise standard and break down the barrier to opportunity for every child .
