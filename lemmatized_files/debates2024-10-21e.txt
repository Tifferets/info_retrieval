it be with great privilege and a deep sense of responsibility that I stand before you today , Madam Deputy Speaker . as I take my place in this historic Chamber , I be acutely aware of the profound trust place in we by the constituent of our great nation . I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of Leicester East for elect I to represent they in Parliament . my story , like that of many in Leicester , be one of heritage , resilience and opportunity . my parent arrive in Leicester from Kenya and India in the late 1970 , bring with they cultural and faith tradition and a remarkable work ethic . they make Rushey Mead their home , and I be bear and raise there . from Herrick primary school to Soar Valley college and De Montfort University , Leicester have nurture I every step of the way and for that I be deeply thankful . as be customary , I pay tribute to Claudia Webbe , my immediate predecessor , who serve the constituency to the very good of her ability . Claudia follow in the footstep of Keith Vaz who , alongside Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant , break new ground in the representation of people of colour in Parliament . in the election , I have the unique experience of stand against both Claudia and Keith — a testament to the vibrant political landscape of Leicester East . Leicester be a city of remarkable history and diversity . leicester host the large Diwali festival outside India . it be home to the UK ' s long running comedy festival . it be one of England ' s old city , so much so that we find a king under one of our carpark ; for those who do not know , one of our early king , King Richard III , be find under a carpark in Leicester . the University of Leicester be the birthplace of dna fingerprinting . Leicester be also home to the National Space Centre and we be proud of our contribution to the art , science and sport . we have get it all go on in Leicester , but if member remain unconvinced that Leicester have influence their life , because perhaps they be not a former monarch or a scientist in their spare time , Leicester have also give Britain icon like the late Lord Richard Attenborough and — very much live — Sir David Attenborough , Gary Lineker and Peter Shilton . our city be where walker crisp be bear and where fashion guru Gok Wan grow up . Leicester ' s influence even extend to music , with entertainer like Engelbert Humperdinck and Showaddywaddy . so whether you have tuck into a bag of ready salt , go to the cinema to watch " Jurassic Park " or boogie on down to " hey Rock and Roll " , you ' ve get Leicester to thank . this be what true diversity look like . in fact , in 2013 Leicester be describe as the most multicultural city in the UK . today , 59 % of people live in Leicester be from ethnic minority group , and 41 % be bear outside the UK . but most relevant to today ' s debate be employment and business in my constituency . Leicester be locate at the heart of England , and local business be the lifeblood of our city . Leicester be recognise as the UK ' s most entrepreneurial city — a title that reflect the resilience , creativity and determination of its people . our entrepreneurial scene be not just about number ; it be about story , of those who dare to dream big , hustle hard , and turn their idea into reality . the Employment Rights Bill threaten to undermine that spirit before those entrepreneur have even make their first £ 1 . the additional cost and regulation propose will act as a barrier to entry , discourage the very innovation and hard work that have earn Leicester that title . we must be cautious not to stifle the ambition of small business owner , who be the backbone of our economy . our journey be one of innovation and community — a story of people come together across different sector and background to build something truly remarkable . in a city as diverse as Leicester , many rely on flexible work to balance family commitment , faith observance or second job . by impose blanket regulation that do not consider the unique need of our community , the Bill risk alienate the very workforce it aim to protect . we must ensure that employment regulation support business and worker alike . impose regulation that add cost without first offer support will harm the very people labour claim to champion . for our small business in Leicester , many of which work with razor - thin margin , the burden impose by the Bill will be overwhelming . it be one thing to champion worker ’ right , but quite another to do so in a way that risk the survival of the very business that provide the job . let we not forget that successful business be the good way to secure meaningful long - term employment . our decision in this House will shape the future of our country for generation to come . it be imperative that we approach these challenge in a spirit of collaboration , transcend partisan divide to serve the good interest of all our constituent . with our nation face economic challenge , the Bill risk raise cost for consumer and worsen the cost of living crisis , particularly in community like Leicester East , where many be already struggle to make end meet . we must find solution that protect worker without penalise local business and their customer . I be honour to stand before the House as the Member for Leicester East , and I warmly invite you , Madam Deputy Speaker , and all hon . member to visit our great city . you can join we for our glorious Diwali celebration , our annual Pride parade or our vibrant caribbean carnival . come and experience the city where fish and chip be just as popular as samosa and kebab , and where Stilton and Red Leicester cheese sit alongside italian pizza and french patisserie . the road ahead may be challenging , but it be also fill with possibility . I firmly believe that not only Leicester ' s but our country ' s great day be ahead of we , and I be grateful to be able to play my part , champion my constituent in that endeavour . thank you , Madam Deputy Speaker . as a proud trade union member , I refer to the House to my entry in the Register of Members ' Financial Interests , and congratulate the hon . member for Weald of Kent ( Katie Lam ) on her move maiden speech . it be with great pride and humility that I rise today for the first time as the elect Member for Hyndburn and Haslingden . I start by pay tribute to my immediate predecessor , Sara Britcliffe , for her commitment to Hyndburn and for lead the way as the first woman to represent the constituency . I can not make this speech without also pay tribute to the previous Labour Member , Graham Jones , whose selfless support and kindness I be privileged to have receive . Graham be the most fierce champion of Lancashire : he have fight tirelessly for the people of Hyndburn , and be a man you always want in your corner . with the north - west of England be scourge with gambling - relate suicide , particularly among young man , Graham lead the successful campaign to reduce the maximum stake on fix - odd bet terminal from £ 100 to just £ 2 . that campaign will undoubtedly have save and improve many life . it may surprise member when I say that Hyndburn be not a real place . no one really relate to be from Hyndburn ; instead , they identify proudly as a resident of Accrington , Great Harwood , Rishton , Altham , Oswaldtwistle , Clayton - le - Moors or Church . each of those community have its own rich history , culture and identity . my constituency be the home of the large Tiffany glass collection in Europe , the Accrington Pals , and the Nori brick , which be use to build the Empire State Building . it be also the home of one of the 12 founder member of the football league , whose legacy be continue by Accrington Stanley football club . I be sure the House will join I in congratulate the boy on their third win on the trot against Barrow at the weekend . perhaps most significantly , my constituency be the engine of the industrial revolution during the 19th century . the invention of the spin jenny , the mechanisation of calico printing , and the creation of turkey red and khaki dye enable the globalisation of the textile industry , but the huge wealth that the mill owner make be often at the cost of the worker , whose live and working condition be terrible . I also represent the magnificent and diverse town of Haslingden , whose coat of arm read " nothing without labour " . that motto be a statement of solidarity : in 1826 , amid loom - break riot in east Lancashire , hundred of people in Haslingden attack machinery in protest at pay cut and their awful working condition . many perish due to poverty and hardship , but by 1850 and with the support of church and reformer , a minimum wage be eventually introduce . we stand in this Chamber almost 200 year later , and although thing have of course improve hugely , too many of my constituent be still struggle to make end meet with zero - hour contract , low wage and insecure work . while in the 19th century , worker have to literally fight for basic right , we now — thank to trade union and the Labour party — have representation of work people in this more civil way . that be why I welcome this Bill , which strengthen employee ’ right , stop the exploitative use of zero - hour contract and , importantly , give people the right to maternity and paternity pay from day one . Hyndburn and Haslingden be a magnificent and beautiful constituency that I be proud to call home . it be where my husband James grow up and where we get marry , in the beautiful church of St Peter and St Paul ' s where his dad , Paul , be the vicar for 18 year . as well as show dedication to his parish , Paul be instrumental in establish the sixth - form provision at St Christopher ' s school , which have change the life of countless young people . tragically , we lose Paul within day of my election , so he be not here with we today , but I will continue to fight to break down all the barrier to opportunity that our child and young people face . without my family , I would not be stand here . I want to put on record how grateful I be to my parent , Rosemary and Gary , to my brother Mark , and to Margaux , James , Ellie and both the Ruths for believe in I and stand by I every step of the way . as a Christian , I also give thank to Jesus for give I this opportunity . as I go on this journey , I will remember always the verse in Micah and aim to carry out justice , to love mercy and to walk humbly with God throughout my time here . I first get involve in politic because I think it be wrong that , far too often , the postcode where people be bear determine so many of their life outcome . for as long as I be privileged to represent Hyndburn and Haslingden , I will work tirelessly to ensure that child bear in Clayton have the same life chance as those bear in Chelsea , and I will make it my mission to represent they in the corridor of power , but I will also make it my mission to be present , transparent , and accessible as a local champion for the resident of Hyndburn and Haslingden . it be an immense privilege to be here today as the Member of Parliament for Dover and Deal . I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members ' Financial Interests : I be a proud small business owner and a union member , and it be fantastic to see so many Labour Members who be small business owner speak in support of the Bill . over the past two year , I have knock on thousand of door , speak to family , business owner and worker , and listen to their hope and concern . today , I bring their voice to this House , but first I pay tribute to my predecessor , who be and still be an ardent champion on housing issue . before the general election , she send a clear message to the country when she cross the Floor of the House to join the Labour party . Dover and Deal be the gateway to Britain , with our port bring £ 144 billion of trade into the country , but it be also a place rich in history , resilience and community spirit . from the iconic white cliff to the fine castle in Britain , and from the newly reopen Roman paint house to the proud former mining community in Aylesham , Snowdon and Betteshanger , we represent the very good of what it mean to be british . we also have beautiful coastal path with some truly great pub stop along the way , as member have probably see from my social medium ; they include the King ' s Head and the Forresters in Deal , the Zetland Arms in Kingsdown and Cullins Yard in Dover . we have castle in Dover , Walmer and Deal . I wonder whether my constituency have the most castle in the country , but I be open to challenge on that . my commitment to public service and hard work stem well and truly from my upbringing . one grandad fly the Catalina fly boat that take out Nazi submarine , and then go on to sell Colman ' s mustard from Cambridge . the other grandad be a lifelong , distinguished Royal Mail worker , and that generation ' s unwavere spirit of hard work run through my family . my father , a dedicated police officer , and my mother , a social worker , show I that real service be about stand strong for other . their steadfast dedication to help those in need teach I that strength be find not in title , but in the service we provide to those around we . that lesson have guide I in my own life — in the Army , in a counter - terror role at the National Crime Agency , and now as the proud Member of Parliament for Dover and Deal . but I do not stand here alone . I pay tribute to my wife — my hero — who come from Estonia at just 18 year of age , 16 year ago . she have always be and will always be my rock , have support I through a very difficult and long campaign . Linda have show remarkable resilience and dedication in turn her passion for dog into her own thrive small business , which will continue to thrive and grow under this new Bill . we have two dog of our own . some of you will know Scooby from the campaign trail . he have become so famous that my Wikipedia page simply state : " personal life : he have a dog call Scooby . " I assure you that I have more of a personal life than that — and a second dog , a puggle call Monki . it be no secret that I be just a little bit patriotic . when you represent Dover and Deal , how could you not be ? for century , we have stand strong against invader and threat , from Napoleon to the Nazis . Dover and Deal have always be at the heart of Britain ' s story , and I be committed to ensure that we remain a proud and prosperous part of the country ' s future . Dover and Deal be where national challenge meet local reality . we be a community on the frontline of issue such as border security , immigration and trade . we face these challenge with the strength and sense of duty that have always define we . under this Government , Dover and Deal will be treat with the respect it deserve . my vision be for a Dover and Deal where our community can thrive , with improved infrastructure , strong public service and more opportunity for young people to build their future there . we be more than a point of transit ; we be a community of hard - work people who keep our port run , our business thrive and our public service go . as we debate the future of worker ’ right , I want to say on record that the P & O Ferries scandal , which affect so many of my constituent , must never be repeat . that be why I fully support this Bill .
