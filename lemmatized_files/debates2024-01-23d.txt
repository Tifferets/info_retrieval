I will give way to the hon . gentleman in a moment , because he know more about this than many who have speak . the reality be that Tata tell we that it be look to pull out completely from the United Kingdom . if the loss of 3 , 000 job be devastating — it certainly be — how much more devastating would 5 , 000 be , and 12 , 500 job in the supply chain ? it be a simple choice for the Government — not a good one — between see 3 , 000 people lose their job or around 17 , 500 people lose their job , and possibly even more . that be why the Government commit to pay £ 500 million towards an arc furnace . let I make one other thing clear : the Government will not pay a penny to Tata until that arc furnace be build . I understand the hon . Gentleman ' s position and he be right to stand up for his worker . this be the reality of the situation : that plan have not persuade Tata . Tata have not say that it be credible . Tata have say to I that it could not go along with that plan , because although one of the blast furnace — blast furnace no . 4 — have a number of year to run , it would still come to the end of the life of the coke plant and the sinter plant , so if Tata go ahead with that proposal , it would keep open one blast furnace , which be still lose a lot of money , and then have to start import all the coke and all the sinter that it would need for it . there be then the technical problem in that Tata say it would be very difficult indeed to build an arc furnace next to a work blast furnace contain molten steel . [ interruption . ] the hon . Gentleman can shake his head , but that be what it be say to we . that be what it have say to we as a Government and that be why we find ourselves in the difficult , unpleasant and awful situation of have to choose between 3 , 000 people lose their job and 17 , 500 people lose their job . that be why we come to the decision we do .
