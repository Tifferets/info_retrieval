certainly we will come into the detail of how this work once it be on the statute book , in the guidance that be issue , but I be make it very clear to the House tonight that the Government wish those few people — the very small number of asylum seeker and refugee who have be convict of serious sexual offence such that they have be put on the sex offender register — to be deny refugee status . we will also deny refugee status where we be able to show that an individual have be convict in a foreign court for a crime that would have fall under schedule 3 to the 2003 Act if they have be convict in the UK . those convict and make subject to the notification requirement have commit the most serious of sexual offence , which should be include in the definition of a particularly serious crime . I shall move on to the amendment relate to the Immigration Services Commissioner . the Government be seek new power for the Immigration Advice Authority to clamp down on malpractice in the provision of immigration advice . build on clause 40 and schedule 1 , these new measure will extend the power of the Immigration Services Commissioner to ensure effective , modern regulation and enforcement of immigration advice and service . government amendment 24 create the power to amend the definition of " relevant matter " for the different type of immigration advice that can be bring in and out of the Immigration Services Commissioner ' s regulatory oversight . it will introduce great flexibility to keep pace with wide modernisation and transformation of the immigration system . currently those definition be in primary legislation , but this amendment move they into secondary legislation . government amendment 25 allow for a person ' s registration as a provider of immigration advice or immigration service to be cancel or suspend with immediate effect where serious concern be raise regard their action or behaviour . government amendment 26 establish that person who have receive certain severe disciplinary sanction can not continue to provide immigration advice under the supervision of a person regulate by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 — otherwise know as substitution . government amendment 27 introduce additional sanction , specifically monetary penalty , and the ability to amend the amount of fine , enhance the range of tool available to the commissioner to tackle inappropriate or unlawful practice by unregistered adviser and to shore up standard . monetary penalty may be impose up to a maximum of £ 15 , 000 on each regulate organisation that have breach the commissioner ' s code of standard , obstruct an inspection or fail to comply with regulation . government amendment 28 provide the Home Secretary with the power to specify a non - exhaustive list of fee that the Immigration Services Commissioner can charge for the exercise of their regulatory function . have the ability to charge for service such as competence assessment and training will enable the Immigration Services Commissioner to provide more of those service , help to drive up competence , capability and capacity in the sector . finally , Government amendment 29 make provision to expand the exist complaint scheme to include unregulated adviser and organisation and to create a civil recovery scheme where the Immigration Services Commissioner can order the refund of fee or the repayment of compensation to the victim of poor practice . the final Government amendment relate to serious crime prevention order and electronic device . to support operational efficiency , Government amendment 6 to 11 will enable an inspector to authorise a constable to use the power to access , examine , copy , retain or use information under clause 20 , 21 and 23 of the Bill . that be think to be more operationally effective than the current measure in the Bill , which place that authorisation at superintendent level , as I be sure the hon . member for Stockton West ( Matt Vickers ) will remember from our long discourse on these matter in Committee . no . for I , border security sit alongside fix pothole , tackle graffiti and fly - tipping , and stop e - scooter and e - bike speeding . it be obviously more complicated — for one thing , it involve a great deal of international negotiation — but border security be security . it be vital for people ' s safety and pride . it underpin so much . if people can not rely on the basic , they can not begin to enjoy everything else that life have to offer . if people can not see pledge be keep , promise be deliver and thing be improve where they live , they will not just lose trust ; they will succumb to hopelessness . we must not allow the spirit of our people to break . we must get the basic right , and with the Bill we will do that . we will secure our border with this Bill and these amendment . we will have new power on seize electronic device , a new law to protect life at sea , a new statutory border security command , tough action on foreign national sex offender , and the ending of asylum hotel that cost eye - watering sum . it be in our national interest to get our border back under control against criminal smuggler gang . in order to understand the politic of where we be , I have be look back at old debate , and Conservative Members may enjoy hear what I be about to say . with our policy and politic on border security , as with much else , I feel that we could benefit from listen to a question that be put by the first Earl of Stockton in his maiden speech in the other place in 1985 . he say : " should we just slowly and majestically sink … like a great ship — or shall we make a new determined and united effort … let we do the latter and then historian of the future will not describe … the decline and fall of Britain but … the beginning of a new and glorious renaissance . " — [ Official Report , House of Lords , 23 January 1985 ; Vol . 459 , c . 254 . ] as the Member of Parliament for Bournemouth East , I want to work with all in this place who share the former conservative Prime Minister ' s moderation and determination to have a united effort to bring about a well Britain . that involve fix the basic , such as border security . after all , it would be an absurdity for small boat to sink a big ship .
