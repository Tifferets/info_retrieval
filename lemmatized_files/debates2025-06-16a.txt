we have the most robust export licensing regime in the world , and I be proud of that . that be a matter that this House vote on just a few year ago under the last government , and the right hon . Gentleman will know that we make a decision to restrict arm sale to Israel that could be use in Gaza . I also refer he to the statement that I have make about Iran ' s nuclear intent , the work of the IAEA , the huge global concern and the UN resolution that the UK do so much to secure last Thursday . I call to mind the work of the iaea , and refer my hon . friend to the resolution of the UN Security Council just last week , all of which confirm Iran ' s intent and its deception .
