Gentleman have make his point . my hon . friend will be aware that foreign donation be not permit in our electoral system , and that be absolutely as it should be . our democracy do face daily threat from rogue state , rogue actor and other who try to disrupt it and to spread myth and disinformation , and these be issue that we should be very alive to . a merry Christmas to you , Madam Deputy Speaker , and to everyone across Parliament and in my constituency . Thornbury and Yate resident drive home for Christmas will face a second festive season of chaos on local road , with at least one more still to come , thank to the ongoing closure of the A432 M4 over - bridge . there be no conversation with the small business affect , or with resident live on the now choke local country lane . give that hundred , if not thousand , of such post - tensioned bridge be build in the 1960 , ' 70 and ' 80 , this horror could be come to many constituency , but I have so far be unable to secure a debate on this important topic . will the Leader of the House ensure that we can discuss the issue in the new year ?
