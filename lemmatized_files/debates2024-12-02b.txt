I completely understand the challenge . draw a line between qualifying and non - qualify leaseholder — between people who own a property and therefore suffer from thing that have be beyond their control , and landlord that be business and therefore have multiple asset — will always be a difficult job . at the edge , where the boundary between qualifying and non - qualifying become blur , there be some difficult case . as a new government , we be commit to work with people to understand well how we can go forward on that . as for the substantive point on where the liability should lie , it be about find the right balance between those who build the building and those who live in it .
