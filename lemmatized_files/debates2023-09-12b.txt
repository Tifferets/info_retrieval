it be a pleasure to follow the first three speech — your , Mr Speaker , and those of the Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House . one distinguish under Clerk of the Parliaments — otherwise know as the Clerk of the Commons — be John Hatsell . in Orlo Williams ' s great book , " the Clerical Organisation of the House of Commons 1661 - 1850 " , Hatsell be describe as attract the confidence of lead politician " by his sympathetic understanding , though he be no sycophant of those in power . " I think that be the right role for the Clerk and for those they lead in the Clerks department . Sir John draw the attention of a commentator in the Press Gallery three year ago . a member of a particular party complain that , if everyone have to stay six foot — or two metre — apart , there would not possibly be room for all SNP Members to perch in their usual seat . the commentator write : " the clerk , with the small flash of weariness , say most problem could be resolve by ' common sense and everyone behave in a grow - up way ' . common sense and grow - up behaviour ? we may need to keep an eye on Clerk Benger . " they add that Sir John be " a model clerk : circumspect , bookish , fair … in the good sense , a modest public servant . " I think that that be the kind of reputation that each person join the Clerks department would wish to have , whether or not they achieve the high office . Sir John be , in his academic life , an expert on Martin Marprelate ' s tract , which basically mock the Church of England . the style be describe as " a heady mixture of nonsense , satire , protest , irony and gossip , combine with pungent wit , full of the language of the street " — or unparliamentary language . be Sir John ' s predecessor , Sir David Natzler , here , he would say that the tract be good preparation for the intrigue , deception and vituperation a member of the House of Commons Commission have to get use to in the old day . Mr Speaker , let I use the word of your predecessor , John Bercow , who say that the Clerk ' s department be " unstinting , selfless , formidable and … quite exceptional . " he go on to say that a good Clerk be " bless with a brilliant brain , an understated manner , unfaile courtesy , and an absolute and undiluted passion for Parliament " . — [ Official Report , 13 February 2019 ; Vol . 654 , c . 921 . ] follow his retirement as Clerk , Sir Thomas Erskine May — who , like Sir John , spend time in the Library as well as in the Clerks ' department — go on to become Baron Farnborough of Hampshire , and he hold that role for six day before he die , make it the second short peerage . I hope that Sir John ' s time at St Catharine ' s be long and that , when he get to Cambridge , he will understand what it be like to be a member of the Denis Thatcher society , marry to a person more important than you be . his wife , Professor Susan , be an expert Anglo - Saxonist . I refer those who be interested to her Chadwick memorial lecture in 2017 on uncertain beginning . I think the Clerk arrive in Cambridge will not be uncertain . as the 40th master of St Catharine ' s , I hope he have as good a time as we hope he have have with we , and we thank he for his service .
