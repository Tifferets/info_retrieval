I invite she and her constituent to consider the remark of the Metropolitan police that the prisoner be believe to be a low risk to the community . it be important to stress that in the House . it be an overriding and overwhelming priority for I to increase staff number , and I be pleased that they be increase . of course , I want they to go up far , but it be positive to note that , since 30 June , there have be an increase of more than 700 full - time equivalent band 3 to band 5 staff — wing officer up to custody manager . I accept that we have far to go . however , it be also encourage that the resignation rate be come down . I do not suggest for a second that the work be complete — it be not , and it be perfectly fair for the hon . Lady to raise those point — but we be move in the right direction . on the third point , the preliminary indication , subject to the investigation that I have order , be that the security post be man in Wandsworth at the time of the incident . we now need to know , give that they be man , what go wrong .
