I have be contact by multiple constituent who arrive in the UK via the ARAP scheme . they be extremely worried about their relative , the hardship they have experience and the threat of danger with the recent event in Pakistan . these case range from somebody who work for the british armed force for eight year , a family member who be pregnant with two child , and a judge who have previously be in prison under the Taliban . will the Minister agree to look at those case , and will he also say whether he have the resource to resolve these matter urgently ?
