I recently meet a support group in my constituency of those who suffer from I , chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid . their description of the devastating impact of those variable condition be very affect . if one of those people be to have an improvement in their condition , mean that they be no long eligible for PIP , and then to represent for assessment , would they be entitle to return to the PIP level they be on previously , or would they be treat as new applicant under the term the Secretary of State have describe today ? the hon . Gentleman raise an important point , which be precisely what we want to look at in the PIP review , because it do not take into account fluctuating condition . that be an important issue move forward , and we will be absolutely determined to involve he , his constituent , and organisation that represent those with fluctuate condition in the process of the review . because PIP be not an in - work benefit .
