it be a pleasure to have sit through the Committee stage of the Bill and to hear the Government talk about the advantage we have from Brexit . I be pleased to hear that the Government have look , and continue to look , extensively at the taxation system — in particular at the interpretation of vat , as mention in this clause . one interpretation of vat in this country massively affect people who be visually impair and those who can not read , perhaps because of dyslexia : there be no vat on book , but the Treasury apply vat at 5 % to audiobook . if that interpretation of vat be to be take as far as it possibly can , I be disappointed that disabled people be not be protect within the structure of the Bill , in the way that they have be for many year . year ago , when I be disability Minister , I be tell that vat change could not happen because we be in the EU . we be no long in the EU and we can set our vat rate as we would like . it would be fundamentally good if the Government come forward with an interpretation of vat that say that people who rely on audiobook , through no fault of their own , do not have to be penalise by vat at 5 % . I be not talk only about the visually impaired — I declare an interest : I be dyslexic and rely on audiobook , although not completely . People who do not read Braille be be punish as well . the Government continue to look at new taxation rule and new way of make sure that people do not get around the taxation system , and it be clear that they be look at the implementation of vat . what well spring present for those who rely on audiobook than for the Minister to say that he will meet I , talk about the issue far and perhaps look at the early - day motion in my name ?
