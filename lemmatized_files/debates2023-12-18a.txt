I thank my hon . friend for make that point . as someone who be self - employ for not far off 15 year , I understand where he be come from . our work coach at Jobcentre Plus office engage with claimant to support access to skill provision . they get a comprehensive range of support , which include apprenticeship , skill bootcamp , vocational and basic training skill , and career advice , so that they can work in a way that suit they . Less than 1 % of worker on zero - hour contract want more hour — it be more about caring or other flexibility — but I be happy to look at the point he have raise in the Chamber today .
