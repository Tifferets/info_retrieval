I welcome this action plan , which mention datum centre . as the Secretary of State may be aware , the Deputy Prime Minister be currently review the need for a data centre in Kings Langley in my constituency . both the report and the Secretary of State talk about ensure that the infrastructure be in the right place . I be work alongside my constituent in Kings Langley , because the propose site be prime green belt . if there be a need to build on and develop the site , housing would make well sense , because energy — a huge requirement for data centre — be not available nearby . how can the Secretary of State ensure that we be not encourage the building of white elephant in the wrong place ?
