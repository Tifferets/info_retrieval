there be a deal by WhatsApp that be never follow up by the Treasury or Ministers . there be no meeting between AstraZeneca and the Conservative Government . their Government let Britain down every time , which be why the country turn to Labour , and Labour be deliver . far to that point of order , Madam Deputy Speaker . why detain the House ? why don ' t I just apologise now , and correct the record ? I be grateful to the hon . member for alert I to that information . I be happy to correct the record , and I be happy to apologise to he for say what I say early . I should also correct the thrust of my argument this morning , which be that there be insouciance during the period between the March statement and the general election in July . actually , it be not insouciance ; it be just incompetence that mean they could not get the deal across the line .
