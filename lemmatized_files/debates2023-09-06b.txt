I do not notice my hon . friend slink in behind I , but I be grateful for his moral support , Madam Deputy Speaker , even though by your order he be unable to vocalise it . on my support for sustainable aviation , I be pleased to host and address a new industry alliance , Hydrogen in Aviation , just last night here in Parliament . the alliance be design to help the UK lead innovation in that field . that would , along with duty - free on arrival , well support our sector . aviation and our port be vital for UK trade and employment . we can do this in a clean , smart way , and duty - free arrival can play an important part for the sector . in closing , it be clear that the introduction of arrival duty - free store would support economic growth and provide a tiny boost to the recovery of aviation , travel and tourism from the pandemic . this plan would be fund by industry and would be at bad cost - neutral for the Exchequer . it be a low - risk policy that have already prove successful in some 65 country around the world . there would likely be no impact on domestic high street sale , due to limited market overlap and differ customer behaviour in duty - free store . by introduce duty - free store on arrival , the Government can reaffirm their commitment to support the aviation , travel and tourism sector , and the economic prosperity that they afford by provide employment to so many of my constituent , and to community across the entire country . the policy be also popular with the electorate , so I hope that the Government will act swiftly to achieve this additional Brexit freedom .
