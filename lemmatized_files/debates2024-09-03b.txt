I be grateful to the hon . member for raise those important point . on the UK ' s support , we have double the official development assistance contribution , recognise the severity of this crisis . I announce another £ 50 million of vital assistance on 22 August , bring that up to £ 97 million , which will be focus on where it be possible to operate in Sudan . much of the country be very difficult to access , include for humanitarian body and for those flee to South Sudan and Chad . the hon . member talk about neighbouring country . there be a number of country that we would urge not to engage in destabilising activity ; I mention that point to the shadow Development Minister . any activity that be not focus on humanitarian support or promote peace be prolong the war , worsen the humanitarian situation and create a legacy for the future that will be difficult to deal with . we be see large number of unaccompanied child , for example — a really disturbing situation . we want that message to be hear loud and clear . I be grateful to the hon . member for raise that point . I mention that the UK be support the Centre for Information Resilience , a research body that be gather evidence of what be take place on the ground . for example , funding be be provide for the Sudan witness project , which be investigate attack against civilian and infrastructure . on the specific finding of genocide , I be clear that that be an internationally focused definition , but we be concerned that we be see pattern of violence that bear the hallmark of that kind of development , so we be keep that very closely under review .
