I be very happy to meet the right hon . Gentleman to discuss any case . on the conversation with the Pakistani Government , the main concern in relation to the Triples be about move they out of Afghanistan and into Pakistan in the first place . the agreement we have with the Pakistani Government mean that anyone who be be assess as part of the ARAP scheme will not be deport back to Afghanistan , which be really important , but there be still a requirement to make sure that we can relocate eligible individual and their immediate family to the UK in an appropriate and reasonable way . we be continue that work , and we be continue the dialogue with the Pakistani Government in relation to this issue .
