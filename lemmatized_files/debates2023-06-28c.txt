where water company underperform and do not meet their target , a process be in place whereby basically they have to credit the money back to their customer . last year , £ 143 million be credit back in that respect . so the regulator do have the tool to do that . it have tighten up so many of its measure , all of which will affect all the water company . for information , Thames Water itself have not pay any dividend for the last six year . Ofwat will rightly hold company to account when they do not clearly demonstrate the link between dividend and performance . we make that possible through the landmark Environment Act .
