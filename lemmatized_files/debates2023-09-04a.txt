I welcome the move the Government have make on this Bill . it be important that they have do so , but they could still go much far . I pay tribute to the work of the right hon . member for Barking ( Dame Margaret Hodge ) on the all - party parliamentary group for whistleblowing , and to the organisation in this sector that do so much to bring light to what can be a very complex and detailed issue . the Minister talk about the UK have a reputation for allow legitimate business to thrive , but we be here this evening to challenge the other reputation that have build up over the year . the UK have now become a hub for dirty money , which be funnel through the UK ' s financial system by an army of enabler . this Bill be an opportunity to dam that flow and to stop this dirty money , but as the excellent " catch I if you can : gap in the Register of Overseas Entities " report , publish by the London School of Economics and CAGE Warwick , say , " there be no point build a dam halfway across a river . " without close the loophole and the gap , that be what this Government be do . the Minister have promise consultation and further thing to come in the future . it be fine to dangle these thing before we , but we all know that we be head towards an election and the Government can not promise to deliver on any of the consultation he hope to bring forward . whatever happen , there will be an election . this House be almost out of time , and we should take the opportunity tonight to do this Bill right . I will run through the Lords amendment , give the time constraint you mention , Mr Deputy Speaker . the Lords amendment on nominee shareholder be table by Lord Vaux , and as other member have say , there be an awful lot more we could do on that . it be not enough for the Government just to say , as they do in their letter to member , that such a measure would most likely be ignore by illegitimate actor and would be difficult to enforce . that be not much of a reason not to legislate and not to try . there be a real issue with how complex structure have be bring about , and the Government need to grab hold of it . this Bill be an opportunity to close a loophole before it be far exploit . enforcement be a big part of this , and the Government do not enforce the current rule . say a measure would be difficult to enforce when they be not enforce the rule to begin with do not give we great confidence . between 2012 and 2022 only three fine be issue for false filing to Companies House . as of October 2022 , only one fine of £ 210 have be issue for not file the person with significant control of a Scottish limited partnership . if the government do not enforce the rule they have bring forward , they can not really ask for more rule . they need to get real about enforcement . they need to make sure the law we pass this evening be effective . update to the register of overseas entity be a significant gap in the system . as other have say , update can take almost an entire year , in which time other thing could happen . event - drive update would hold company to account . if we think about it , there will be paperwork when company make any change , so they might as well do the update at the same time . that would be logical . lord amendment 117 in the name of Lord Agnew , on the transparency of trust datum on the register of overseas entity , make a critical point . we must deal with trust without further delay , without further consultation and without kick the can further down the road . here be the opportunity to do that . as Transparency International and the BBC show in February , trust be be use to hide the ownership of thousand of overseas entity under the current regime . they estimate that more than 7 , 000 overseas entity on the register , about a quarter of the total , be hide the ownership of roughly 20 , 000 property . why would the Minister not want to close that loophole ? why would he not want to improve this system right now ? it be not as though the Government be not warn on this . they be talk about consult and do more on it , but they be warn about this when we have the Joint Select Committee on the draft Registration of Overseas Entities Bill . in March 2019 , Professor Jonathan Fisher KC say : " if I be ask to advise , on the face of the draft legislation , the first thing I would say be , ' have you think about set up a trust ? ' " . he go on to say : " I might say to someone , ' if you really want to do this Technicolor , why don ' t you have an offshore company and have the share of the company put in trust , and when you set that trust up , why don ' t you think about set it up as a discretionary trust ? " if it be a discretionary trust , the beneficiary do not rank as a beneficiary in law ; all they have in law be the right to be consider by the trustee when capital income be distribute . " so all kind of thing be already identify and very clear to the Government , have be highlight in evidence , and they could have put these piece of evidence into this Bill to make sure that we be close the loophole now , rather than allow this to spiral yet far . it be also very evident that this database need to be accessible to the wide possible group of people , because the law enforcement , particularly under this government , do not have the money , expertise or time to go into this in significant detail . let I highlight some of the scale of the issue . we owe a great debt of gratitude to Graham Barrow , as a researcher into these thing , in his own time , as a Companies House geek . he say that the use of brass plaque address for company incorporation have increase since lockdown . he have do an analysis of two main address be use . in Shelton Street , between 2018 and 2022 , the number of incorporation at the one brass plaque address grow by 340 % , from 6 , 200 to 27 , 350 . similarly , the incorporation in Wenlock Road also grow significantly , by 40 % . those be just two address , and the number be increasingly significantly . that be due to the loophole that the Government have allow and the corporate structure that currently exist . we seek further amendment to tighten this and prevent these brass plaque address from be use for hundred and thousand of company . there be certainly more the Government could be do to ensure that trust do not fall down on this point ; allow people to register trust in a similar way will result in the same issue .
