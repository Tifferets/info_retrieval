all trans child and young people deserve access to high - quality and timely healthcare and support . around 100 study have not be include in the Cass report , and we need to know why . [ Official Report , 22 April 2024 ; Vol . 748 , c . 663 . ] ( Correction ) the Secretary of State be obviously not concerned about the way that the Cass report have be use to perpetuate a broad hostile environment towards trans people in the UK — a hostile environment create in part by the Government ' s delay in reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 . misrepresent the report , and the high - and - mighty attitude from the Secretary of State , help no one . will she commit to the extra funding need to help young people have a holistic approach to their healthcare pathway ? I thank my hon . friend for his question . we want to not just help with crisis support , but prevent our young people from get into a position of crisis in the first place , so we be roll out mental health support team , ahead of our schedule , across school . that be a really important piece of work that will help 44 % of the student population , but we want to go even far . in the 12 - month period end in March 2021 , we increase the number of child and young people age under 18 who receive nhs - fund mental health service to some 758 , 000 . of course , we want that support to be there in the community , but importantly we also want to help clinician to understand that this be just one of several set of condition that they should have confidence to work on , in order to look after the child holistically .
