I thank my right hon . friend for his statement and for remind the House about the first - time funding for coal tip . I notice that the Plaid Cymru Member , the hon . member for Ynys M ô n ( Llinos Medi ) , mention coal tip , but she could not leave the Chamber quickly enough — she could not wait for the end of the statement . I pay tribute to the local authority , emergency service , volunteer and all those affect by Storm Bert in Cardiff , in Rhondda Cynon Taf and across south Wales . may I ask my right hon . friend to speak to colleague in the Department for Science , Innovation and Technology about look carefully into the role of the Met Office ? it be clear that its response be slow and that there be an underestimation of the impact of storm Bert : it put out a yellow rather than an amber or red warning . our constituent have be let down by this incompetence before . it can not keep happen .
