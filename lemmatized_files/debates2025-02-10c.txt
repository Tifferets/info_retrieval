I thank and pay tribute to my hon . friend the Member for Birmingham Erdington ( Paulette Hamilton ) , who bring the debate to the House this evening . all hon . member will agree that her passion and commitment to her constituency and this subject shine through . I can only say what an absolute honour it be to visit her constituency to discuss the work of the north Birmingham economic recovery board . I will come shortly to the situation in Birmingham and the approach that my hon . Friend recommend that the Government take . I hope that her remark at the end of her speech on the purpose of politic and the role we all must play in give everybody a chance and an opportunity in our society would be support across the House , but she make the case well for that approach . and so to Birmingham . this debate be important for many reason , not least because some part of our country suffer much bad than other with poor employment outcome . the Government be commit to move towards our goal of an 80 % employment rate , though some place in our country be already there . unfortunately , that be not the case in Birmingham where the employment rate be around just 66 % . that be not acceptable because when some part of our country fall behind economically , it be bad for those place and bad for all of we , because it mean that some people in our country can not play their full role in our economic growth . economic inactivity be also high than the average , and that be why our reform plan take a different approach . we be no long do the same thing everywhere , but try to tailor and personalise our employment support to where people be and what they need .
