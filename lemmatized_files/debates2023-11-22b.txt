my right hon . and learn Friend be right to highlight the issue . a number of thing have be say about this matter that be not the case . the money will be make available in Northern Ireland , and it have be set aside . if memory serve , it be about £ 15 million , but I would need to double - check — if I be incorrect , I will write to he . the reality be that we need decision to be take by a restore executive , and the Government be keen to work with Northern Ireland Ministers to that end . I be grateful to he for highlight this point and give I the opportunity to say that the money will be spend in Northern Ireland .
