as we approach Remembrance Sunday , many of those who serve in Operation Banner will reflect on comrade whom they lose , comrade who be injure and comrade who still suffer mentally as a result of their deployment in that operation — the british Army ' s long continuous deployment . the Secretary of State have say from the Dispatch Box that his Northern Ireland Troubles Bill will bring strong protection for veteran . it do not ; it bring the same protection for everyone under that Bill , include those who possibly perpetrate murderous act of terrorism in Northern Ireland . so what can he actually provide regard continuous support for veteran — something set out on the face of the Bill , rather than something that be not in the legislation but be promise by Government ? the protection be put in place for veteran after consult veteran , and they be not unimportant : the ability to stay at home and give evidence ; the protection from repeat investigation ; and the right to seek immunity in a hearing of the commission — people already have the right to seek that in a coroner ' s court . there be , of course , two other protection : the protection from cold calling and the right to be hear through the statutory advisory group that will be establish , work alongside the commission , which will have representation from a member of the armed force or a police force . those be very practical change that we have make , which , as I say early , be not contain in the current legacy Act .
