I be obviously concerned to hear that case . we have just have a consultation on the possibility of move from collect and pay to direct pay for all claimant , which would certainly help to put a great focus on compliance . although I be more than happy to arrange a meeting , I be not sure that one with I would be much help , because I be not in charge of child maintenance . I will ask the relevant Minister in the Lords to have a meeting with the hon . member .
