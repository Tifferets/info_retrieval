the sub - postmaster have no trust or faith in the compensation process be handle by the Post Office or the Government . today ' s commitment will still not deal with all the inequality in the scheme or the undue influence that the Post Office still have on the process . echo the sentiment of some of my hon . friend , may I ask the Minister to agree to place the compensation scheme into an external independent body , completely outside the influence of the Post Office ? I ask the Prime Minister , as my hon . friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow ( Rushanara Ali ) have ask , about the timescale for the legislation to overturn the conviction , but we still have not get an answer . if it be not before the general election , will it be before the summer recess ? finally , when will people be hold to account for this miscarriage of justice , be it within the Government , the Post Office or Fujitsu ?
