as ever , my hon . friend raise an excellent point . that be what Operation Prosperity Guardian be all about : that taskforce enable ship to be protect to an extent . he may be get at the broad point of whether individual ship should be protect . the view that the world have take be that Prosperity Guardian provide an umbrella to ship more widely . the sheer volume of ordinary traffic through the Red sea mean that we need that US - lead international taskforce for the security of the Red sea and the gulf of Aden . this be incredibly important . after all , we be part of defend the international rule - base order in the action that we be take . last week , I be onboard HMS Diamond — which be right at the heart of the issue in the Red sea — talk to our brave sailor who be out there protect our critical sea lane . the House will know that this be the first Royal Navy ship ' s company for 32 year who have fire in anger — or in self - defence , in their case . it be fascinating to talk to they about their experience and to witness their professionalism in deal with this challenge . it really do not have to be this way . we work hard to warn the Houthis off . at the start of the year , the world send a very clear message to the Houthis : " end your illegal and unjustified action . stop risk innocent life . please stop illegally detain vessel and crew . cease threaten the global economy . " all those warning fall on deaf ear , and eventually enough be enough .
