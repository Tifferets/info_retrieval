I refer hon . member to my entry in the register of interest . at his first Prime Minister ' s Question Time in July last year , I ask the Prime Minister to reassure my constituent that they would have a meaningful say over the new development in the green belt in their area . he say that the Government " will work with community " — but this Bill could not be far from that promise . we be see housing target go through the roof in rural area , as green - belt protection be remove . in my local council of East Herts and Broxbourne , the target be go up by more than 20 % and within Broxbourne district specifically they be almost double . the loss of protection for unrestricted sprawl around the village I represent be extremely worrying for my constituent who live in those village of Brickenden , Hertford Heath , Great Amwell , Stanstead Abbotts and St Margarets , as their unique character and historical charm could be lose forever . at the same time , target be go down in London , where there be the infrastructure to cope . the plan do not add up . there be something in this Bill on which I can agree with the government : the explanatory note state that limited infrastructure delivery be a real cost on the life of work people . I completely agree . it be far too common for new housing to be build without the increase in public service capacity to match .
