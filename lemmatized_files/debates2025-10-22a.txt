12 . 40 pm with permission , I will update the House on the step this Government be take to realise the benefit of expansion at Heathrow airport , have invite proposal for a third runway early this year . today I be launch a review of the airport national policy statement . Britain want to fly , and this Government will act to meet public aspiration . our review of the ANPS will ensure that while we unlock long - term capacity for more flight at the nation ' s only hub airport , we will also meet our obligation to passenger , community and the environment . today be a step forward for UK aviation and infrastructure , support growth in the economy and enable a modern , efficient transport system that harness international investment , boost connectivity and strengthen UK competitiveness . we be committed to make a decision on a third runway at Heathrow within this Parliament , and we be clear in our ambition to see flight take off on a new runway in 2035 . we say we would get on with this , and we have . when the previous Government set up the Davies commission , it take they five year to publish the original draft ANPS . we will get to the same point in 18 month , with the process complete by the end of 2026 , show our commitment to deliver progress swiftly but robustly . when we say we back the builder , not the blocker , we mean it . but this be not a blank cheque . expansion at Heathrow must minimise cost for passenger and customer . the taxpayer must not be expect to foot the bill . that be why the scheme will be privately finance — both the core project and the related infrastructure improvement . extra staff and passenger must be able to get to and from the airport without turn the M4 and M25 into Europe ' s large car park . crucially , the expansion must align with our legal , environmental and climate commitment . start the review of the ANPS be critical to deliver expansion and will provide the basis for decision on any future planning application . the world have change since the last ANPS review in 2018 , which be when it be designate . new environmental and climate obligation have be introduce , and pattern of travel have change . however , pretty much every UK airport see its busy summer on record . we could put our head in the sand and pretend this be not the case , but we would be do a disservice to our economy and to the next generation . that be why , in carry out this review , we will consider how any propose scheme must meet four clear test : that it contribute to economic growth across the country ; that it meet our air quality obligation ; that it be consistent with our noise commitment ; and , crucially , that it align with our legal obligation on climate change , include net zero . we will seek the independent opinion of the Climate Change Committee , which I will write to shortly to request this advice . while a third runway at Heathrow have be factor into carbon budget 6 , it be right that we update our modelling and seek the view of the CCC . give Heathrow ' s national importance , we will also consider name the airport as critical national priority infrastructure , in line with our approach to low - carbon energy project . we be far consider whether to name a statutory undertaker as an appropriate person to carry out the project under the Planning Act 2008 , provide additional clarity to stakeholder and the local community . it be clear that this be a large and complex programme that require a thorough and evidence - lead approach . over the come month , my Department will develop analysis on economic and environmental impact of expansion . we will also undertake an appraisal of sustainability , as require by statute , alongside a habitat regulation assessment and other necessary technical work . if amendment be need to the ANPS as a result of the review , we expect to consult on an amend policy statement by next summer . community will be able to have their say and we will shortly publish an update stakeholder engagement approach to ensure transparency and fairness throughout the process . early this year , we invite potential promoter to submit proposal for deliver a third runway at Heathrow . seven proposal be receive and be consider by official from the Department for Transport , the Treasury and expert financial and technical adviser . follow that assessment , two potential scheme remain under active consideration : a proposal from Heathrow Airport Limited and a proposal from the Arora Group . we know that we must provide as much clarity and certainty for community , investor and user of Heathrow as soon as possible , so we be seek further information on the two propose scheme with a view to reach a final decision on a single scheme to inform the remainder of the ANPS review by the end of November . when make that decision , we will consider : the interoperability of the propose scheme with exist infrastructure ; the plan for transport to and from the airport and associate road scheme ; the land take and impact on surround home and community ; the evidence that the scheme can be privately finance ; and the economic benefit of the scheme . this Government be commit to move quickly but we will also do this properly . to deliver the scheme on time , the Government be also press ahead with a series of enable reform . the Planning and Infrastructure Bill will streamline the delivery of major infrastructure , include Heathrow . that include fast consent route and more proportionate consultation . on judicial review , we have announce that we will work with the judiciary to cut the amount of time it take for a review to move through the court system for national policy statement and nationally significant infrastructure project . we be establish the UK Airspace Design Service to deliver modernised airspace . that will initially prioritise airspace design for the London region , support both Heathrow and the wide network , and will also make flight path more efficient so that plane spend less time over London . we will initiate slot reform to ensure future allocation maximise benefit of an expand heathrow , as well as approve growth at Gatwick and Luton for passenger , local community and business . expand Heathrow will be one of the large infrastructure project in the UK . rigorous and effective cost control will be essential to its success , both in minimise any impact on airline charge and cost to passenger and in maintain credibility with financial market . the Government will therefore work with the Civil Aviation Authority to review the framework for economic regulation for capacity expansion at Heathrow , ensure the model provide strong incentive for cost - effective delivery . we expect the CAA to publish a work paper in November , with a view to that work complete next summer . this be a landmark opportunity for Heathrow , for the aviation sector and for the UK economy . the Government remain fully committed to ensure the expansion be deliver in a way that be timely , cost - efficient and environmentally responsible . I commend this statement to the House .
