I be grateful to have secure today ' s Adjournment debate on an issue that affect community across the country : the condition of our road . although I will focus on the situation in Cheshire and in my constituency of Chester South and Eddisbury , and on what I believe be a failure by local authority to get to grip with the issue , I will begin by set the context and reflect on the broad systemic problem with how we repair and maintain our road network . the Public Accounts Committee recently publish a report on the condition and maintenance of local road in England . it show that this problem be widespread ; that the Department for Transport do not have a good grasp of the real condition of local road in England ; and that fund arrangement to local authority be likely to be push they to focus spending on short - term , reactive work . in my view , this reactive rather than proactive approach to road maintenance in Cheshire urgently need to change . instead of neglect route be identify and tackle , particularly in rural area , we see a pattern of piecemeal catch - up on individual pothole rather than long - term , cost - effective repair that offer real value for money .
