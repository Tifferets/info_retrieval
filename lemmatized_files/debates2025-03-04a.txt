I welcome the Minister ' s statement . the Israelis have do a huge amount to dismantle Iran ' s influence in the middle east , so will the Minister ensure that we carry on give Isreal the support to ensure Iran be not able to re - establish that influence in some area through Hezbollah and Hamas ? will he also ensure that british company be not supply component to Iran through a series of country with which they can trade , and that we be able to achieve our stated objective on that supply chain ?
