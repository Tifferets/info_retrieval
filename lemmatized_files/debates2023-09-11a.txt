we take very seriously the work that the Defence Committee do ; we enjoy read the Committee ' s report and , as I hope member of the Committee and of the House recognise , often take the finding into policy . I do push back gently , however , because in addition to the incredible work of QRA and the support the Royal Air Force have give to NATO mission over the last 18 month , since the start of the war in Ukraine , they have also be able to support carrier strike deployment , deployment on Exercise Red Flag , and indeed the deployment of a below squadron in strength , all the way across to Australia . that get to exactly what I tell my hon . friend the Member for Witney ( Robert Courts ) : that this ability to deploy air force with great agility , far from home , in more austere setting , be a step change for the Royal Air Force , allow it to operate from more austere environment rather than solely from its home basis .
