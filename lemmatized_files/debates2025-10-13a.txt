we know the very basic fact , which be that the Director of Public Prosecutions ask for a statement from the Government to clarify that , at the time of the offence , China be a threat to national security . he say in his letter that such an assurance , or evidence , or a statement from the Government be not forthcoming . we know that the Government withhold that vital element of the case . the Minister be shake his head , but who decide that , in the word of the DPP , it would " not be forthcoming " . somebody decide that . he seem to be say that it be the deputy National Security Adviser who be somehow accountable for make those decision , but I question that point . to whom be they accountable , if not the National Security Adviser ?
