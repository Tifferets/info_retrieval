it be a pleasure to speak on Third Reading . it be important , when the Animal Welfare ( Kept Animals ) Bill be set aside , that a commitment be make to bring legislation forward , and this be a key element of it . it be a key element of our manifesto commitment that we will fulfil , and frankly the other House should stop bleat about this element . we will get the other aspect do . I myself be take a private Member ' s Bill through that cover one element of the keep animal Bill . we should not be play tit for tat on this . it be about something that really matter , the welfare of animal , and this be a really important stage . the Minister have read out a litany of what we have achieve in our time in office . the one person who can not speak in this debate be my hon . friend the Member for West Dorset ( Chris Loder ) , who take through the Animal Welfare ( Sentencing ) Act 2021 with the support of the Government . as the chief executive of the RSPCA say , that be a monumental moment for animal welfare legislation , empower the court to hand out sentence that more accurately reflect the seriousness of these crime . I strongly support the Bill . I say to the House , and to the other House , that it be a simple , straightforward Bill and it could get through by the end of March and be do by Easter , without question . this be not the moment to add other element leave , right and centre . let we keep it simple and keep our manifesto commitment . I hope the House of Lords respect the will of this House , and I look forward to the Bill not come back but become an Act before the end of the spring .
