the hon . Gentleman be welcome to choose his tone ; I will continue to the end of my comment . my job be to come and explain the Government ' s decision , and to be hold accountable for it . that be what I be do today , and what I will continue to do over the course of my remark . it be right that the Government be then ask question about their decision ; that be the nature of this democracy , as the hon . member for East Wiltshire say . an important consideration in the Government make this decision be that evidence show that send people unsolicited letter be unlikely to affect what they know . that be why letter be send only as part of wide communication campaign . this evidence be not properly consider by the ombudsman . another consideration be that the great majority of 1950 - bear woman be aware of the state pension age change , if not of a change in their specific state pension age , as several hon . member have point out . my hon . friend the Member for Salford mention the statistic of 43 % , refer to the 2024 rather than 2023 survey . however , as she will know , that refer to all woman , include some woman as young as 16 ; if we look at the cohort of woman bear in the 1950 , the figure be far , far high . on those and other ground , we reject the ombudsman ' s approach to injustice and remedy . member will be aware that litigation be live , so I will not go into lot more detail on the research evidence , which be the core of that litigation . I will just say two thing : first , our decision be base on publish research report , which be robust and meet professional standard ; secondly , the same awareness research , which the right hon . member for New Forest East disparage , be use by the ombudsman .
