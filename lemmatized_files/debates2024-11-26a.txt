it be a pleasure to follow such powerful contribution from member on both side of the House — from my hon . friend the Members for Suffolk Coastal ( Jenny Riddell - Carpenter ) , for Southampton Itchen ( Darren Paffey ) , for worthe West ( Dr Beccy Cooper ) and for Mid Cheshire ( Andrew Cooper ) , and the hon . member for North Dorset ( Simon Hoare ) , for Harrow East ( Bob Blackman ) and for Bath ( Wera Hobhouse ) — as well as the entire Ulster Unionist party delegation in the form of the hon . member for South Antrim ( Robin Swann ) . I support this landmark legislation , which be an important step towards deliver on this Government ' s manifesto commitment to ensure that the next generation can never legally buy cigarette , and to create the first smokefree generation . this be an overdue natural step towards tackle the scourge of smoking , which claim about 80 , 000 life a year in the United Kingdom . smoking be the no . 1 preventable cause of death , disability and ill health in our United Kingdom , and it be responsible for one in four cancer death , kill up to two third of smoker . in Wales , tobacco cause 3 , 100 cancer case every year , and smoking be still the lead cause of cancer there . however , cancer do not respect border , so the Bill will serve the health interest of our entire United Kingdom . I welcome that , and I also welcome the Welsh Government ' s commitment to support this legislation and bring it into force in Wales from 2025 . in fact , the Welsh Government have be well ahead of the curve on this issue . as far back as 2016 , my constituency colleague Mark Drakeford present legislation that would have ban cigarette use in public space , but it fall owe to shameless politicking on the part of Plaid Cymru — whose member , I note , have not be present at all for this important debate . rather than agree with the Welsh Government and introduce what would have be landmark public health legislation , Plaid Cymru ' s member be join by the Welsh Conservatives and the Members of the United Kingdom Independence party — remember they ? — all of whom describe it as unnecessary Government regulation . Plaid Cymru side with the populist right in Wales to make a political point , and the people of Wales be bad off because of it . undeterred , in 2021 the Welsh Government launch their tobacco control action plan , which include action to protect child and young people from the danger of vaping , such as tight regulation on advertising and on the sale of e - cigarette . that be a clear sign that the Welsh Government take this issue seriously , and it be our responsibility here in Westminster to support and complement those effort . this Bill illustrate that this Government take seriously their commitment to create the first smokefree generation , and to protect child from become hook on vaping . let we be clear : vaping be not harmless . in 2023 , action on Smoking and Health estimate that 20 . 5 % of child age 11 to 17 have try vape . although vaping can be an effective way for adult to quit smoking , vaping can not be recommend for child , as it carry a serious risk of addiction and future harm . accordingly , rather than be a deterrent to smoking , vaping will see more child , not few , be expose to nicotine if leave unregulated . that be why the measure set out in the Bill to implement a total ban on vape advertising and sponsorship , and , subject to consultation , on the sale of vape flavour that overtly appeal to child , be so important . I fully support they . this Bill be legislation that our teacher , headteacher , medical professional and health service be all call for . the vaping industry have be allow to attract kid with different flavour and bright packaging . we would not allow that with any other addictive drug , and we should not allow it with vaping . in addition , the Bill do not deal with an aspect of vape that I would be grateful for the Government to consider as the Bill continue its passage through Parliament . currently , police officer do not have specific power to confiscate vape from child — a power that they do have with traditional cigarette , pursuant to section 7 ( 3 ) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . have speak to South Wales police officer and police community support officer , I know that the power of confiscation be an important tool that they use to deal with antisocial behaviour in designate area of Cardiff , but their work be neuter if they can not confiscate vape . although I recognise that if this Bill be pass , such power will not be necessary in time — indeed , it will omit section 7 ( 3 ) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 from 2027 onwards — I ask the Government to consider whether it would be useful to retain the power of confiscation and expand it to include vape for the period between now and 2027 , so that our police officer have the same legal power across cigarette and vape as a tool in their armoury to combat antisocial behaviour . aside from that specific point , I reiterate my support for this important piece of legislation . not only will it align this Parliament with the progressive action of the Welsh Government on such important health matter ; it will bolster our commitment in this place to safeguard public health . in so do , it will save many thousand of life from the scourge of cancer and protect child from become hook on vaping .
