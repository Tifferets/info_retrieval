Lady seem to want more delivery stat , so let I help she out . as my right hon . friend , the Minister without Portfolio , say , we have have the high growth of any G7 economy in the first quarter of this year , cut in interest rate and an expansion of the warm home discount , which will mean that 6 million household will benefit from well insulate house . I do not claim , in read out these statistic , that everything be perfect — far from it — but I do believe that we have have change in the past year : change in the investment pattern of the country ; change in real wage ; and change in our trading position . that be change well worth have .
