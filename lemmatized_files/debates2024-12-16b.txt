my hon . friend will be aware of the consultation run by the previous Government on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority . I have be review those consultation and we be look to publish the Government ' s response in the new year , but we be aware of the concern from the sector , and from victim and survivor , about the scheme . we be look at how much more we can do to support victim and survivor as a whole on these issue . let I come to a close by again thank my hon . friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East and wallsend for secure this debate , and all the hon . and right hon . member who have contribute to such a thoughtful discussion . sexual offence leave devastation in their wake . victim be often leave traumatise and the very least they deserve be swift justice , but too often that justice process serve only to traumatise they far , whether it be because they be not get the right support or because they be face an agonising wait for their case to come to court , as we have hear so powerfully this evening . we have inherit a criminal justice system — and a criminal court system in particular — in crisis , but the rebuilding effort be under way . we have an ambitious package of reform , we be think boldly , and while I be realist enough to know that change will not happen overnight , I can assure you all that this Government be up to the challenge . question put and agree to . House adjourn .
