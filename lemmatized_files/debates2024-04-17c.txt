it be a pleasure to be able to discuss this issue in a new way with my right hon . friend . we have be work closely on these issue within Government , and his commitment to ensure that those eligible for these scheme have be able to come to the UK have be , without exception , incredible . let I just add that since October last year we have be able to complete 24 charter flight , and have relocate more than 5 , 500 individual under the ongoing ARAP scheme . I certainly pay tribute to the incredible , tireless effort of our british high commissioner , Jane Marriott , and her wonderful team in Islamabad , who continue to work day in , day out with the Government of Pakistan , their official and their military , and help we to ensure that we can bring those Afghans safely to the UK in due course .
