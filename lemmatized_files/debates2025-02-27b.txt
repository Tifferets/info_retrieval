my hon . friend speak powerfully about the careful use of language and the way in which we all have a responsibility to uphold the high standard on that . on her specific question , have have discussion with the BBC , I can confirm that this be not a BBC programme ; it be commission by an external organisation . that in no way absolve the BBC from the responsibility to undertake due diligence on a programme that it air . when it be air by our national broadcaster , it be grant the legitimacy of our national broadcaster , and that be why these standard matter . I will take away her suggestion about a publicly available translation guide , which might help to assuage some of the concern raise by the hon . member for Mid Buckinghamshire ( Greg Smith ) , and discuss that with the BBC .
