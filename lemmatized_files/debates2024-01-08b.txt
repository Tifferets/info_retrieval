I welcome the Secretary of State ' s commitment to reach a fair and reasonable solution to the strike . Worcester go into this winter with the delivery of a new emergency department and be able to deliver 21 bed - worth of extra capacity over the winter , but I have hear from the hospital today that it be still face intense pressure . will the Secretary of State join I in pay tribute to the staff who be work around the clock to meet that pressure , and will she support the South Warwickshire University NHS foundation trust as it work to address some of the key transport bottleneck on its site , in the interest of patient and staff alike ?
