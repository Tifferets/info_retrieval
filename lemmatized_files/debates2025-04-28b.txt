I completely agree with my hon . friend ' s comment , and I pay tribute to the work of Blackburn Rovers in their community . we be probably all aware of the example of Everton and Manchester United . both be up to their ear in debt while either building or plan to build stadium that cost between £ 750 million and £ 1 billion . if we look low down the league , the sum be still eye - watering . York City lose £ 235 million last season , Salford City lose £ 5 . 3 million and Stockport County lose £ 7 million . it be difficult to see how , at some stage , without regulation , more and more club will not simply go to the wall . the financial precarity in football be such that it leave the club open to bad actor seize on their financial vulnerability to offer a route to potential success . I be , of course , refer to dirty money and the pernicious practice of sportswashe by dubious owner who see club ownership as a pr vehicle to airbrush their misdeed and human right abuse to reconstruct their reputation and exert geopolitical influence . it be deeply regretful that this odious and morally corrupting practice have be allow to establish a foothold in our game since Roman Abramovich come to England as the owner of Chelsea football club with dirty money from Russia . he be find to have fund or donate over £ 100 million to illegal settlement expansion in the west bank . the other issue I want to raise be around agent fee . in 2022 to 2023 , over £ 408 million be pay by Premier League club to agent and facilitator , and in the football league over £ 65 million be pay in agent fee . some agent be act on behalf of both the player and the club and receive remuneration from both . if that be not a conflict of interest or a potential bribe , I do not know what be . I strongly encourage the Government to look at this and try to stop as much money go to agent and get it back into grassroots football .
