I think the hon . Gentleman have just talk himself into a job . he be absolutely right that the good people to advocate for stop smoking be former smoker . we will still encourage adult smoker to switch to vape through Swap to stop in England , and I be delighted that locality have ask for over half a million starter kit so far . on advertising regulation , of course the consultation will take place after Royal Assent , but I hope that I can assure the hon . member for Harrow East that we will take away his point about ensure that the NHS can still advertise Swap to stop under those regulation . on a tobacco industry levy , fiscal matter be for the Treasury , but I be sure that his view and those of other have be communicate to Treasury Ministers . the hon . member for Lewes mention the rise of the black market . this be a line that have be parrot by the tobacco industry for year , so we need to spell out the fact . whenever government of any guise have introduce target tobacco control measure , the black market actually have not prosper . consumption of illegal tobacco have go from 15 billion cigarette nearly 25 year ago to just one 10th of that amount last year , and when the last Labour Government raise the age of sale from 16 to 18 , the number of illicit cigarette fall by a quarter . however , this require well enforcement , and we will use every second of the generously long buffer period to support business in prepare for and implement the change , include through information campaign . we be provide £ 10 million to trading standard to increase their capacity and capability next year , and there be £ 100 million for Border Force and his Majesty ' s Revenue and Customs over the next five year to tackle illicit and under - age sale . the Bill also allow trading standard to issue on - the - spot fine of £ 200 , and to reinvest the proceed of those fine , and indeed the licensing regime , back into further enforcement .
