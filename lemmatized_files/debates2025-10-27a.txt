I congratulate the Minister on bring forward this raft of very important change . it be a pleasure to follow the hon . member for Rochester and Strood ( Lauren Edwards ) . I would ask my hon . friend the Member for Maidenhead ( Mr Reynolds ) to address the point raise — I be not qualified — but I imagine that the purpose of new clause 12 be to make technical change so that the measure be even more effective , which , clearly , we would all support . in any case , my understanding be that it would require the Secretary of State to bring forward such change rather than stipulate what those change be in detail . like other , I warmly congratulate the hon . member for Bolsover ( Natalie Fleet ) on a very impressive and powerful speech . I know that the Minister congratulate she in advance on the campaign she have run . equally , the hon . member for Knowsley ( Anneliese Midgley ) make a very powerful speech . my hon . friend the Member for Wimbledon ( Mr Kohler ) and my hon . friend the Member for Maidenhead make strong case as well . I repeat the reminder of my hon . friend the Member for Chichester ( Jess Brown - Fuller ) that the primary purpose — this be certainly what I have always say — of custodial sentence must be public protection . it be on that issue that I wish to concentrate . my remark be entirely inform by a case I have be pursue on behalf of my constituent Tina Nash . the Minister be aware of this , because I have correspond with she on the subject . Tina be horrifically attack by her former partner in 2012 for a 12 - hour period until she manage to escape . in that time she be batter and have her eye gouge out and her jaw and nose break . it be an appalling beating that she be lucky to survive — and a survivor she be . the following year her former partner be jail for life with a minimum term of six year . however , early this year he be move to a category d prison , with open condition . my constituent be not consult about this and be only inform about it after the decision have be take . bear in mind that she be blind , it be understandable that she fear that , if she go out shopping , he could be in her company without her knowledge . she be incredibly scared as a result of the decision . she have no say in it , and nor be she consult . I table new clause 17 to urge the Government to accept that victim have a right to a veto in reasonable circumstance for their own protection — not in all circumstance and not in every condition , but we should certainly ensure that they be properly consult . as a result of this experience , I think there be a number of other failing in the system that require the Government to ensure belt - and - brace support for victim throughout the process . Tina want to pursue this matter with the Parole Board , but it do not respond to she until my intervention , and then there be an offer of a meeting . that be not good enough . it should not be down to a Member of Parliament to force a response . she be give the support of the victim contact scheme , which I will come to in a moment . my constituent be give the opportunity to complain — the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman provide she with a complaint form — but month after she have complete the complaint , she be inform that the ombudsman have assume she be the prisoner , not the victim . can that level of incompetence or her treatment throughout the process be believe ? she be treat appallingly , while the process waste her time and stress she out . her complaint be reject as outside the PPO ' s remit — that fact be not initially communicate to she — which cause her enormous distress and confusion . despite circumstance in which she be blind by her perpetrator , she still somehow have to navigate and overcome all these process and problem . of course , the PPO apologise for its error , but with a lack of empathy for my constituent in an officious response that direct she to the Victims ' Commissioner . I turn to Tina ' s interface with the victim liaison officer and the victim contact scheme . this week , I receive further communication from she in which she say that she have be attempt to seek support from the service and make inquiry about the restorative option that might be available , as mention by my hon . friend the Member for Wimbledon . I think it be incredibly brave of she even to consider that in such circumstance , but she be prepare at least to explore what that would mean , how she would go about it and so on . Tina get a response from her victim contact officer . in her message to I , she say : " he shout at I that the perpetrator be scared of I . so they be now try to make I feel like I be the perpetrator and the perpetrator be the victim … and they have to protect he . " that be from the victim contact scheme , which be there to support the victim , not to defend the perpetrator — what be go on ? she continue : " so I have remove myself from the victim contact scheme . I do not trust they … I be not be support . " that simply be not good enough . what be happen to the system to allow such circumstance to arise ? hon . member might think that my new clause , which would entitle victim to a veto , be an unreasonable request , but something have to be do . Tina have be appallingly let down by the system . if a victim who have go through all that be treat in such a manner , we really do need to strengthen the system and not allow it to continue as it be . she have be tell that her perpetrator be now remorseful and contrite about the whole thing , but I wonder whether psychopathy of people of that nature be fully understand . they can be as violent as that , and they can also act up and persuade professional that they be remorseful . I think it be theatrical contrition and insincere repentance , and I worry that the system be vulnerable to such people . I urge the Minister to look again at this area and ensure that victim and survivor be properly support .
