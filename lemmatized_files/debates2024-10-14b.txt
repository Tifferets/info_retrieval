I really regret this playground - style characterisation of issue that be so fundamental , particularly for those who live in Gibraltar . I mention the comment of the Chief Minister of the Falklands , and the right hon . Member have now force I to quote they , give the nature of what he have just say . the Chief Minister say some of these claim be " more about party politic , blame - gaming and Tory Party leadership issue … than " they be actually about the sovereignty of people who live in the overseas territory . he could not have be clear .
