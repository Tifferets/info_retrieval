let I say to the hon . Lady that as someone who be hospitalise after be attack because of my sexuality , I know how difficult that be . it be not just the attack that be painful but what be leave afterwards . I will continue to raise each of these issue , but I want to make this point . I keep hear that we do not care about LGBT issue . it be this Government who introduce same - sex marriage , and it be this Government who introduce it in Northern Ireland . it be this Government who introduce ture ' s law in 2017 . we have modernise gender recognition certificate and make they affordable . we have remove self - funding for fertility treatment for same sex - couple , lift the ban on blood donation , and tackle LGBT - relate bullying in school . we have apologise for the way in which LGBT people be treat in the armed force , and we have provide funding to ensure that LGBT right across the Commonwealth be protect .
