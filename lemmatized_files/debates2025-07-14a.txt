on Friday , the BBC interview an egyptian economic migrant in Calais who say that he have try and fail four time to cross the channel but , since the Prime Minister ' s agreement with President Macron , he be give up : " I don ' t want to go to Britain any more , because they be make it much hard for we . every time we try , they deflate our boat and remove the engine . if they make it even hard , I ' ll stop try . " do that not prove that this new deal to send migrant back to France can be a genuine deterrent , unlike the last government ' s pathetic attempt to claim credit ?
