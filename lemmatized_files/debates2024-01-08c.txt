two gps from Seatown , in my part of Devon , move to Australia to practise a little over two year ago . both be work as full - time GPs , with no gap in their career , and they now wish to return to east Devon to help ease winter pressure . reteste someone who return to England be lengthy , costly and bureaucratic , and it do not take into account practice in similar primary care setting . can NHS England not make it easy for UK - train gps work in Australia , New Zealand or Canada to return to general practice in England ?
