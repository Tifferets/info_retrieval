I be delighted to take part in this debate , as I be always grateful for the opportunity to praise and defend our public service , particularly our state school , and the million of people , include the vast majority of my constituent , who rely on they . the Opposition motion " regret that the Government have decide to impose vat on independent school fee " . well , I regret that the last Tory Government do all they could to deliberately and carefully dismantle , defund and destroy our public service , include state school , for 14 year — [ interruption . ] there be a huge amount that I could say , but we be push for time and many member want to speak , include lot of Government Members . I know there be more of we here — every day . indeed . there be a lot that deserve to be say about our school . we have hear many conservative Members ask about the impact . they suddenly care about the impact of decision make in this place , but where be their talk of impact over the past 14 year ? in St Helens North , 81 % of school have have real - term funding cut since 2010 — over £ 3 million in real term , or £ 239 for every pupil . where be the consideration of impact when the last government cancel labour ' s Building Schools for the Future programme and watch our state school crumble ? where be the talk of impact when the last government preside over a SEND system that be fail over 1 million child and that their own Education Secretary describe as a " lose - lose - lose " ? where be the concern for impact when standard fall , which they do ?
