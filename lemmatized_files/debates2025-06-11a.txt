I thank my hon . friend for raise this . I believe this Government will seize the opportunity of net zero for work people , create good , skilled job and take they off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil - fuel market . under past government , hard - work community have their pride and their job rip away , and we will never do that in relation to a transition . we have already see £ 40 billion of investment in energy and renewable , and the CBI datum show that 38 , 000 job in Wales be link to clean energy . I want to see more of that ; both the Conservatives and Reform be against it .
