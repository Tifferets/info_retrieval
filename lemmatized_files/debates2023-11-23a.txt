my hon . friend obviously know a great deal about this as a result of his distinguished 31 year of experience in the House , but pivotal role allowance have be in place for 10 year to help we to retain certain key individual . a number of initiative be introduce by my distinguished predecessor Lord Maude , the former right hon . member for Horsham , and I intend to build on those , but I be happy to engage with my hon . friend , because this be a serious issue . in 2022 , the last year for which we have figure , there be a 12 . 4 % turnover from the senior civil service , and resignation be at 5 % . we need to look carefully at what that mean across different role , and at how we can retain the specialism for long period so that key Government programme benefit from the sort of leadership that have endure expertise at the table .
