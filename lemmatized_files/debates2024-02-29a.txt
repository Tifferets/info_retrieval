I meet several union leader a few week ago . on 2 October , the Chancellor announce that the civil service would be cap at the level that be current at that time , which would save up to £ 1 billion against the trajectory that be then in place . as of September 2023 , there be 496 , 150 civil servant . it be an important Government responsibility to ensure that we have the right number of civil servant perform effectively and efficiently in public service , and we will continue to work on that . one of the strength of the Union of the United Kingdom be that we can choose different way of do thing , often achieve the same outcome and certainly share our objective . she will know this Government ' s record in this area : we have 1 million few workless household and , base on recent figure , we have lift more than 500 , 000 child out of poverty . we all must work on these thing , whatever particular system cover our nation .
