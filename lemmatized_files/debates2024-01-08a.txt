a happy new year to you , Mr Speaker , and to all colleague . as at October 2023 , 55 . 4 % of civil servant be female — a rise of 0 . 7 percentage point compare with 1 October 2022 — and 11 . 7 % of the UK regular armed force and 15 . 9 % of Future Reserves 2020 be woman , up by 1 . 2 percentage point and 1 . 4 percentage point respectively in the past five year . that mean that the trend be in the right direction , but we can do well , and I be confident that we will do so across the defence enterprise .
