Iran be now produce roughly one significant quantity of highly enriched uranium every six week . that be 40 time above the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action — the deal that we strike with Iran , which I have in front of I . I be really crystal clear about this . Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon ; it must reverse its escalation — we have see that in its enrichment programme ; it must not carry out any critical weaponisation work ; and these term have to be fully verifiable . unless we get that , we will see a snapback of the sanction regime that we strike with it 10 year ago . the right hon . Lady be right . on 3 May , counter - terrorism police arrest eight individual , include seven iranian national , as part of two separate police investigation . of course the Minister responsible for the middle east , my hon . friend the Member for Lincoln ( Mr Falconer ) , have speak to the israeli ambassador . as I say , on 4 March we put Iran on the foreign influence registration scheme . we keep proscription under review . we be fully engage with our E3 partner , and we be very pleased that Germany now have a government so that we can work with they together on the JCPOA and snapback , and of course we be speak to Steve Witkoff .
