on 30 April 1999 , three nail bomb go off in London , kill four and injure 140 . one of they explode at Brick Lane , the hub of London ' s Bengali community ; one explode in Soho , at the Admiral Duncan pub , the heart of London ' s gay district ; and one explode in Brixton , in an attack on south London ' s black community . the sick terrorist who commit those evil act be motivate by hatred . he hate Bengalis and black people because of their race . he hate LGBT people because of who they love and how they live their life . he hate those group because they be different from he . he hate they because of who they be . I raise that appalling incident to remind the House that hatred come in many form , but whoever in our society it be against , we must all stand equally strongly against it . we must have hate crime law that show that whether the hatred be for someone ' s race , religion , sexual orientation , gender identity or disability , Britain be a country that will not tolerate it ; that all hatred be equal ; and that all those who commit vile act of hatred will face the same grave consequence . I regret to say that that be not currently the case . today the law recognise five category of hate crime — race , religion , sexual orientation , transgender identity and disability — but only two , race and religion , be treat as aggravate offence subject to strong sentencing power ; the other three be not . that discrepancy can not be right . we can not say , as a society , that some form of hatred be more evil than other . I be at university when section 28 be introduce — I remember it vividly . it be more than a law ; it be an attack on the right of people like I to live openly . it stigmatise lesbian , gay and bisexual people ; and it push we out of public life . I go into politic to fight that cruel law and everything it represent . Hate corrode our entire society . it do not just harm the individual who be target ; it create fear — fear to go outside , fear to speak up , fear to be see . it silence people . it make we all afraid . research by Stonewall find that less than half of LGBT + people feel safe hold their partner ' s hand in public . that be the impact that the fear of hatred have on people . it make they afraid even to show the world that they exist . unfortunately , far too many recorded crime never result in charge . of 11 , 000 disability hate crime record by police , 320 lead to prosecution . of 22 , 000 homophobic hate crime , 3 , 118 lead to prosecution . of 4 , 000 hate crime against transgender people , only 137 lead to prosecution . behind those statistic be real people , whose scar may heal on the outside but who may never recover from the fear and trauma that they have suffer . in 2024 , a teenage far - right extremist be jail for target and attack a transgender woman . along with another young man , he kick she to the ground in a park in Swansea and hurl transphobic abuse at she . in 2022 , Cassie , a phd student and wheelchair user , be wait outside a shop when two drunk man grab her wheelchair , push she down the road and make sexual comment . she have to escape by roll into traffic . we must fight back against this hatred . we must show that we be not content to stick with the status quo . the victim of these attack deserve to live in a society that say that we take this hatred seriously and will not stand for it . victim must be at the heart of our criminal justice system , and we must ensure that law protect they . that be why my new clause 122 be so important . LGBT and disabled people tell I that they do not feel as safe as they use to . we be see rise transphobia everywhere . pride flag be be take down at county hall , and some politician be openly question whether disability be even real . I be proud that Labour , in our manifesto , commit to equalise our hate crime law by make hate crime against LGBT people and disabled people aggravate offence . I be proud to be bring forward that change through new clause 122 . I hope that I can persuade all my parliamentary colleague to support the new clause today , and to take this important step forward for equal right . I thank my hon . friend the Members for Burton and Uttoxeter ( Jacob Collier ) and for Penistone and Stocksbridge ( Dr Tidball ) for stand shoulder to shoulder with I throughout this process , and I urge the House to support the new clause . as mps , we receive a wide range of correspondence from constituent during some of the most difficult time in their life , but the email that I receive from Emma Johnson be perhaps one of the most harrowing that I have ever receive . it be because of Emma ' s story that I have table new clause 51 , and I will speak to it today . on 18 November 2022 , Emma have just go into labour with her young child . mother and child be okay when she receive a call inform she that her parent have be tragically kill in a car crash . the driver of the other vehicle have no licence and be uninsured . on what be suppose to be one of the happy day of Emma ' s life , she instead have to identify the body of her parent , Ian and Gail . when the case come to court , the driver of the other vehicle be charge with the less offence of cause death by careless driving , rather than by dangerous driving . that produce the sentence available to the court , even though he be swerve in and out of traffic , and drive without a licence or insurance . I put it to the House that this , by its very nature , be dangerous . since the verdict , Emma have be fight — not for vengeance , but to make sure that no other family have to suffer the same injustice . she have seek justice not just for her parent , but for other people who face the same heartbreak . she be call for a simple but vital change : any driver who kill while drive without a licence or insurance should automatically face the more serious offence of cause death by dangerous driving . today I say directly to Emma , who I know be watch , that I fundamentally agree with you . your dedication to the cause be commendable , and you be do your late parent proud . we know that road accident happen , but if someone wilfully get behind the wheel of a car when unlicensed and uninsured , and swerve in and out of traffic , that be not an accident ; it be a dangerous choice to put other ' live at risk . new clause 51 would rightly treat such behaviour as seriously as drive under the influence of drug or alcohol . it would close a loophole in the current law and bring great justice for victim . if the new clause do not progress today , I ask the Minister to meet I and Emma to ensure that her campaign continue .
